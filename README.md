# IFAC2020_SplitFuture_MPCcharging

This repository contains a battery charging control algorithm using a split future model predictive control formulation proposed in the following publication


<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405896320317365?via%3Dihub">M. A. Xavier, A. K. de Souza, and M. S. Trimboli, “A split-future MPC algorithm
for lithium-ion battery cell-level fast-charge control,” in Preprints of the 21st IFAC World Congress (Virtual), pp. 12638– 12643, 2020.</a>

- mainMPC.m is the main file to run the MPC algorithm
